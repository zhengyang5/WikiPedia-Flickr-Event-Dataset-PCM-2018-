# Multi-domain and Multi-modality Event Detection Dataset (MMED-100)
This is to release the dataset for cross-domain and cross-modality transferring learning, i.e., MMED-100 dataset. The dataset consists of 23500 Flickr images and 9722 news articles from hundreds of online news media.

The links of the images are included and can be downloaded from the URLs. (You can also obtain all from this [URL](https://mail2gduteducn-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/2111605074_mail2_gdut_edu_cn/En8k14FD9yFIrxivdHd6dxkBaAC_0Pv8AzOpoUZ8r2c60A?e=NFjRXx).
